    "\n",
    "So far we have attempted to build our own deep learning framework from scratch in numpy to implement fully connected networks. While it could be fun to continue in this vein and end up with a `DS677Torch/Flow` library, it would take a lot of work for us to be able to run experiments quickly and at a large scale. We will now migrate to using PyTorch (using TensorFlow is similar, especially with the eager mode in v2.0 and above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages of using a deep learning framework:\n",
    "* Our code will now run on GPUs! This will allow our models to train much faster. When using a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow you can harness the power of the GPU for your own custom neural network architectures without having to write CUDA code directly (which is beyond the scope of this class).\n",
    "* You will likely use PyTorch or TensorFlow for your project, and this is an opportunity to get familiar with it.\n",
    "* Implementing some of the basic functionality by hand should have helped you understand the guts of PyTorch/TensorFlow. Now you can iterate on top of that base of knowledge.\n",
    "* If you are running deep learning code in your next job, this is likely what you'll be using.\n",

    "In this assignment, you will learn PyTorch on **three different levels of abstraction**, which will help you understand it better and prepare you for the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Barebones PyTorch: **Abstraction level 1**, we will work directly with the lowest-level PyTorch Tensors and use the Functional API to implement layers and networks.\n",
    "2. PyTorch Module API: **Abstraction level 2**, we will use `nn.Module` to define arbitrary neural network architectures. This is the version you will commonly see in research/prototyping code (this is how I write networks in my experiments, for instance). This is flexible enough to implement arbitrary architectures while affording some convenience.\n",
    "3. PyTorch Sequential API: **Abstraction level 3**, we will use `nn.Sequential` to define a linear feed-forward network very conveniently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after going through the above exercises, you will attempt an open-ended challenge on CIFAR-10. Please implement your own network (avoid pre-defined models in the PyTorch library) to get as high accuracy as possible on CIFAR-10. You can experiment with any layer, optimizer, hyperparameters or other advanced features.\n",

    "You can manually switch to a GPU device on Colab by clicking `Runtime -> Change runtime type` and selecting `GPU` under `Hardware Accelerator`. You should do this before running the following cells to import packages, since the kernel gets restarted upon switching runtimes. Alternatively, if you have access to a GPU some other way, you may use that resource. It is strongly recommended that you use a GPU since it allows you to run experiments on CIFAR-10 much quicker than you would on a CPU."

    "\n",
    "Barebone PyTorch requires that we track all the parameter tensors by hand. This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you define your Module subclass, you can instantiate it as an object and call it just like the NN forward function in the barebones section."

    "#### Things you might try:\n",
    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5; would smaller filters be more efficient?\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",
    "- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster?\n",
    "- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips for training\n",
    "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Going above and beyond\n",
    "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
    "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
    "  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n",
    "  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n",
